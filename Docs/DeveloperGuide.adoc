== Milestones



== Technical requirements
The project will work using Amazon Web Services (EC2 and S3) for the storage of content and would be backed up in a local server if the client wishes to do so. In that case, a server will be needed and also one extra computer for management. Out of it, there are needed 5 personal computers to manage the program on a daily basis by the shop employees.


== Limits and Exclusions
This project is exclusively only catered for clothing stores who wish to list their clothes online. This platform is not suitable for any other product forms and is not integrable with other platforms unless otherwise specified. Itâ€™s also important to note that scope of usage of this platform is as defined in the project scope.


== Review with customers
The customer review will be measured after the first release. It is intended to survey the client periodically to identify the strengths and user satisfaction.
After that, we could escalate the project to an online software store to deploy it to any store model, but that would be in a second stage of our software company.
